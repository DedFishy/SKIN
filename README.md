All of the other Minecraft Java Edition skin editors I have tried are annoying and clunky. Hopefully, you will find this one less annoying and clunky!
### Features
- Edit both the base and outer layers of a skin
- Edit all sides of a skin's parts
- Design both a Classic and a Slim skin
- Draw with any color using a resizable brush or bucket fill tool
- Select colors from the design with the eyedropper
- View a live preview of your skin in 3D
- Interact with the 3D model by rotating it, setting a pose, and clicking surfaces to edit them
- Load local skin files or download them from a Minecraft account
- Export skin files in the correct format
- Easily control the interface with single-button keyboard shortcuts
### How to Use
#### Brushes
Clicking or dragging across the image on the left of the page will use your selected tool.
##### Draw
This tool will simply paint a square wherever you click. You can control its size using the Size slider that appears when this tool is selected.
##### Eyedropper
This tool will set your current brush color to the color of whatever pixel you click.
##### Bucket Fill
This tool will fill all adjacent pixels with the color that you click with your brush color.
#### Keyboard Shortcuts
Keyboard shortcuts are indicated by keys within square brackets. Pressing the corresponding key will activate the control that it indicates.
#### Model Preview
The 3D model can be rotated by dragging with your mouse cursor. Your scroll wheel will zoom in and out of the model. Dragging with your right mouse button will pan the scene. Clicking a surface on the 3D model will select that surface in your texture editor.
### Libraries Used
- THREE.js - for the 3D skin preview
- Ion Icons - for the UI icons
